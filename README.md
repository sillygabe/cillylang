# Welcome to The Silly C Programming Language!

The Silly C Programming Language (otherwise known as Cilly) is a project for my school based on LLVM.
The syntax is going to be C like (hopefully).

# Builtin types

Cilly has the most useful types:
1. int (64 bit numbers)
2. flt (64 bit float numbers)
3. str (string)
4. map<type, type> (hash table)
5. arr<type, size> (static array)
6. list<type> (dynamic array)

These bois allow you to build anything.
